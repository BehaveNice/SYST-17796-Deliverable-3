SYST 17796  Deliverable 3


In Deliverable 2 you committed to a design for your game and you will have received feedback on the design. The first step for Deliverable 3 is to incorporate that feedback so you have a firm UML class diagram of the final game so that you can begin to code. 
The same standards for groupwork, professional writing style and citations apply to all deliverables. If you have questions, you can refer to the project description or ask your instructor. The project requirements are not to be reduced for groups smaller than 4 students. Any groupwork conflicts will be dealt with using the contract from Deliverable 1.

To begin, you will update your UML Class Diagram, incorporating the feedback you received in Deliverable 2. You should include methods and attributes for each class. 

Next, complete the code to satisfy the rules of the game (requirements) and the use cases you defined (scope). Ensure the final version is checked in to your Git repository.
